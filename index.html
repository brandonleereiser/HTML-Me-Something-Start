               <h2>My First job out of highschool</h2>
            <p>
         After graduating from high school, I was swiftly recruited by the Department of Defense as a military sales specialist. Although I didn't find much enjoyment in most aspects of the job, I did persevere in this role for approximately three years. Surprisingly, this job afforded me the opportunity to travel to numerous countries, enabling me to gain invaluable insights into various cultures and ways of life.

         <h3>My traveling advetnrues</h3>
         <p id ="testP" class="funParagraph">
         I was allowed to travel to over 100 countries in this role, I got to go to parts of the world people only dream of. I got to go to countries like north korea, russia, thailand and china all within 6 months. Thailand will always hold a special place in my heart as i met my husband their and lived their for five years with him and fell in love with the people and culture. I didn't enjoy every part of this job but the traveling is what made me stay for as long as i did.

         <h4>How i met my ex husband</h4>
         <p>
         I met my husband in a little village in thailand called อุบลราชธานี or as we would say in english Ubon Ratchithani. This village is quite small and far from the capital city of bangkok sitting directly on the border of Thailand and Laos. It was the most beautiful place i have ever seen, there is even a song written about this town and the famous river the runs through it, the river is called Moon river and the song is Moon River by Audrey Hepburn. This town is also famous for having one of the largest US air force bases outside of the US in it.

         <h5>My life after that job</h5>
         <p>
         After i decided that this job was no longer the best for my future me and my now husband moved from thailand back to St.Louis where i am from and i went back to school to finish my schooling. I had already completed some before moving but decided to finish my bachelors and masters degrees in education. After this i was hired at an elementary school as a third grade teacher. I love my job and getting to be around children every day is one of the greatest things i have ever done with my life and dont regret any of it. The reason i am pursuing launch code for a future job change is due to the fact that my friend does this kind of work and seems to love it, he gets to work from home and go at his own pace. When i do eventually change jobs i will miss these kids more than anything.

         <h6>My divorce and future with Launch Code</h6>
         <p></p>
         About six months ago me and my husband decided to get divorced, it was a big change in my life but i do believe it was for the best. This shift was the main reason i decided to join launch code and pursue a different career path as a way to reset my life after whats going to be the hardest challenge i have ever faced. Getting divorced is the hardest thing i've ever had to do, although i am definitely happier after the fact it doesn't change the fact that most of my adult life was with this person who will not be around me anymore. My friend told me about launch code, he works at ATT and says they hire many people from this program and they are excellent workers and he enjoys them being apart of his team, i am excited for the opportunity and plan to work hard to succeed in this class.
